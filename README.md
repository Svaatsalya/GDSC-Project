# GDSC-Project
This is my first Project
<br>
I have developed a Habit Streak Counter website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating the Bootstrap framework for a responsive and visually appealing design. By utilizing Flexbox and Grid, I have created a streak calendar that effectively tracks user progress. Additionally, I have carefully selected fonts and colors to enhance the website's aesthetics and usability
